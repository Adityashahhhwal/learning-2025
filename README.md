## 1. Snapshot

| Track | Current Emphasis | Tooling | Last Updated |
|-------|------------------|---------|--------------|
| Full-Stack Foundations | Frontend fundamentals (shipping small UI projects) | Git, vanilla JS, browser devtools | Feb 2026 |

Goal: Build breadth (frontend → backend → data) while keeping code quality, iteration discipline, and measurable progress visible in this repository.

Near Term Shift: Introduce backend (Node.js + Express) + data persistence (JSON store → SQLite/PostgreSQL) while continuing small frontend iterations.

---

## 2. Featured Project

**Amazon Project (E-commerce UI)**

Live: https://adityashahhhwal.github.io/learning-2025/05-amazon-project/javascript-amazon-project/amazon.html

Highlights:
- Product catalog rendered dynamically from data.
- Cart stored in localStorage with quantity edits and delete flow.
- Checkout with delivery option selection and dynamic delivery dates (dayjs).
- Modular JS structure with reusable data helpers.

## 4. Skills Matrix (Evolving)

| Domain | Foundation | In Progress | Planned Depth |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Frontend | HTML, CSS basics | Layout systems, accessibility | Component architecture |
| JavaScript | Syntax, control flow | Modules, async patterns | Performance, testing rigor |
| Backend | — | Routing, REST design | Auth, caching, service layering |
| Data | — | Basic persistence (file/JSON) | SQL schema design, indexes |
| Testing | — | Unit tests (Jest) | Integration + CI |
| DevOps | Git basics | Branch discipline | GitHub Actions workflows |
| CS Fundamentals | Big-O basics | DSA practice cadence | System design intro |

## 5. Roadmap (2025)

| Phase | Focus Areas | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Q1 (Jan–Mar) | HTML/CSS semantics, core JS, DOM, problem decomposition | ✅ In Progress |
| Q2 (Apr–Jun) | Modular JS, testing intro (Jest), async, API clients | ⏳ Planned |
| Q3 (Jul–Sep) | Backend fundamentals (Node.js/Express), persistence, error handling, logging | ⏳ Planned |
| Q4 (Oct) | Performance, accessibility, refactors, deployment (Render/Vercel) | ⏳ Planned |
| Q4 (Nov) | Framework exposure (React OR Vue) + component patterns | ⏳ Planned |
| Q4 (Dec) | Capstone mini full-stack project + retrospective | ⏳ Planned |

Parallel Thread (all year): Data Structures & Algorithms (arrays, strings, hash maps, stacks/queues, recursion, sorting, complexity analysis).

Principles: ship small | measure | refactor | document learning.

---

## 6. Computer Science Practice Plan

Weekly: 3–5 focused DSA problems (implementation + complexity note).
Topics Sequence: Arrays → Strings → Hash Maps → Stacks/Queues → Recursion → Sorting → Trees (intro) → Graphs (intro).
Tracking: Add brief notes in `cs-notes/` with solution rationale; emphasize clarity over clever optimizations early.

---

## 7. Engineering Conventions

- Naming: descriptive, lower-case folder names (`rock-paper-scissors/`).
- Each project: minimal scope, no unused assets, README snippet or comment header.
- Commits: imperative mood, single responsibility (e.g., `feat: add score persistence draft`).
- Logging (backend later): structured where practical; meaningful error messages.
- Security (when backend starts): validate input, never trust client, minimal dependencies.

---

## 8. Quality Checklist (per Project)

1. Purpose documented (1–2 lines).
2. Runs without console errors.
3. Mobile-friendly viewport tested.
4. No dead code / unused assets.
5. If logic > trivial: add a brief TEST PLAN section (manual steps) until automated tests exist.
6. Reflect: add a one-line “What I learned” to log.

---

## 9. How to Run Locally

1. Open a project folder.
2. Use a local server (Live Server or similar) so ES modules load correctly.

---

## 10. Continuous Improvement Log

- 2026-02-09: Enhanced checkout delivery options and dynamic delivery dates.
- 2025-09-06: Added DOM interactions project and simple calculator (projects 01-02).
- 2025-09-02: Added full-stack & CS roadmap to README (broadening scope).
- 2025-09-01: Initial Rock Paper Scissors implementation.

> This log evidences cadence and progression over polish.
