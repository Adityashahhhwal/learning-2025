# Learning 2025 – Full‑Stack & Computer Science Journey

<strong>Deliberate practice across front‑end, back‑end, and core CS foundations.</strong><br/>

## 1. Professional Snapshot

| Track | Current Emphasis | Tooling | Last Updated |
|-------|------------------|---------|--------------|
| Full‑Stack Foundations | Frontend fundamentals (shipping small UI projects) | Git, vanilla JS, browser devtools | Sept 2025 |

Goal: Build breadth (frontend → backend → data) while keeping code quality, iteration discipline, and measurable progress visible in this repository.

Near Term Shift: Introduce backend (Node.js + Express) + data persistence (JSON store → SQLite/PostgreSQL) while continuing small front-end iterations.

## 2. Project Portfolio (Incremental)

| Project | Layer | Tech | Focus |
|---------|-------|------|-------|
| [DOM Button Interactions](https://adityashahhhwal.github.io/learning-2025/01-dom/) | Frontend | HTML, CSS, JS | DOM manipulation, event handling, CSS classes |
| [Simple Calculator](https://adityashahhhwal.github.io/learning-2025/02-calculator/) | Frontend | HTML, CSS, JS | User input, state management, basic math operations |
| [Rock Paper Scissors](https://adityashahhhwal.github.io/learning-2025/03-rock-paper-scissors/) | Frontend | HTML, CSS, JS | Game logic, DOM updates, conditional logic |
| (Upcoming) Form Validation Lab | Frontend | JS, Constraint API | Input handling, UX |
| (Upcoming) Simple REST API | Backend | Node.js, Express | Routing, JSON responses |
| (Upcoming) Score Service + Persistence | Backend | Node.js, SQLite/Postgres | CRUD, data modeling |
| (Upcoming) API Consumption Mini App | Full‑Stack | Fetch, REST | Async patterns |
| (Planned) Auth Prototype | Backend | Sessions / JWTs | Security basics |

> Folder-per-project. Self‑contained. Clear README or top comment stating purpose + what was learned.

## 3. 2025 Roadmap (Expanded)

| Phase | Focus Areas | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Q1 (Jan–Mar) | HTML/CSS semantics, core JS, DOM, problem decomposition | ✅ In Progress |
| Q2 (Apr–Jun) | Modular JS, testing intro (Jest), async, API clients | ⏳ Planned |
| Q3 (Jul–Sep) | Backend fundamentals (Node.js/Express), persistence, error handling, logging | ⏳ Planned |
| Q4 (Oct) | Performance, accessibility, refactors, deployment (Render/Vercel) | ⏳ Planned |
| Q4 (Nov) | Framework exposure (React OR Vue) + component patterns | ⏳ Planned |
| Q4 (Dec) | Capstone mini full‑stack project + retrospective | ⏳ Planned |

Parallel Thread (all year): Data Structures & Algorithms (arrays, strings, hash maps, stacks/queues, recursion, sorting, complexity analysis).

Principles: ship small | measure | refactor | document learning.

## 4. Competency Matrix (Evolving)

| Domain | Foundation | In Progress | Planned Depth |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Frontend | HTML, CSS basics | Layout systems, accessibility | Component architecture |
| JavaScript | Syntax, control flow | Modules, async patterns | Performance, testing rigor |
| Backend | — | Routing, REST design | Auth, caching, service layering |
| Data | — | Basic persistence (file/JSON) | SQL schema design, indexes |
| Testing | — | Unit tests (Jest) | Integration + CI |
| DevOps | Git basics | Branch discipline | GitHub Actions workflows |
| CS Fundamentals | Big-O basics | DSA practice cadence | System design intro |

---

## 5. Computer Science Practice Plan

Weekly: 3–5 focused DSA problems (implementation + complexity note).  
Topics Sequence: Arrays → Strings → Hash Maps → Stacks/Queues → Recursion → Sorting → Trees (intro) → Graphs (intro).  
Tracking: Add brief notes in `cs-notes/` (to be created) with solution rationale; emphasize clarity over clever optimizations early.

---

## 6. Engineering Conventions

- Naming: descriptive, lower-case folder names (`rock-paper-scissors/`).  
- Each project: minimal scope, no unused assets, README snippet or comment header.  
- Commits: imperative mood, single responsibility (e.g., `feat: add score persistence draft`).  
- Logging (backend later): structured where practical; meaningful error messages.  
- Security (when backend starts): validate input, never trust client, minimal dependencies.

---

## 7. Quality Checklist (per Project)

1. Purpose documented (1–2 lines).  
2. Runs without console errors.  
3. Mobile-friendly viewport tested.  
4. No dead code / unused assets.  
5. If logic > trivial: add a brief TEST PLAN section (manual steps) until automated tests exist.  
6. Reflect: add a one-line “What I learned” to log.

## 8. How to Navigate

Project Hub (deployed): https://adityashahhhwal.github.io/learning-2025/  
Each folder = one self-contained exercise or feature slice. Backend services (later) will live under `api/` with clear separation (`api/<service-name>/`).

Planned directories:
```
api/            # future backend experiments
cs-notes/       # data structures & algorithms notes + solutions
scripts/        # helper scripts (e.g., project scaffolding)
```
